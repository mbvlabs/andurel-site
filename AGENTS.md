# Agent notes for andurel-site

This is an Andurel application. Use the `andurel` CLI instead of inventing file paths, URLs, or generator names.

## Discovery

```bash
andurel commands --json
andurel inspect project --json
andurel doctor --json
```

## Common commands

```bash
andurel generate scaffold <Name> --dry-run --json
andurel generate migration <name>
andurel db migrate up
andurel sync queries --json
andurel inspect routes --json
andurel run
```

## Hosts and URLs

- Default identity is `HOST_PRIMARY` in `.env`. Extra hosts need a `routing.HostName` const in `config/hosts.go` plus a matching `App.Hosts` entry (load `HOST_<NAME>` yourself — not scaffolded).
- `--host` and `--prefix` are independent: `--host` selects the Echo/`routing.HostName`; `--prefix` is only the path/package namespace. `--host` must match a known `HostName` (`primary` always works; others come from app `routing.HostName` consts).
- Declare the host on the route with `routing.Host(config.HostAdmin)`. Controllers call `r.AddRoute(route, echo.Route{...})`; Fx stays `RegisterRoutes(r)`. Assets and `/api` stay on primary unless those routes set `Host(...)`.
- Never invent frontend URLs in Inertia apps: import `resources/js/routes.ts` after `andurel sync routes --json`. Helpers return full URLs once `configureRouteHosts` runs from the shared `hosts` prop at boot. Use `routes.name.path()` for a relative path.

## Process graphs

Fx process graphs live in `internal/runtime`. `cmd/app` calls `runtime.App`; `cmd/queue` calls `runtime.Queue`. Register new services, controllers, and workers in their package `Module`. Add process-wide providers (email drivers, extra Fx provides) in `internal/runtime`.

`cmd/migrate` applies pending SQL with `storage.RunMigrations` on `migrations.Migrations`. It is a one-shot process, not part of `cmd/app` start. Development still uses `andurel db migrate up`.
